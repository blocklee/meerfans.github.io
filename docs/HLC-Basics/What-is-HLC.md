# What is HLC?

## Summary

HLC is the native cryptocurrency used on the HalalChain network. Since the main network of HalalChain is still under development, HLC is still only the token of ERC20 standard.

The main network of HalalChain will adopt the way of combining POW consensus protocol with DAG technology to ensure security and improve throughput at the same time. The main network token (maybe HLC or other) will be used to reward miners who secure transactions. 

HLC will also have many current use cases, such as a store of value (e.g. in lending collateral), a medium of exchange (e.g. in trade and payments), and a unit of account (e.g. in digital marketplaces).
